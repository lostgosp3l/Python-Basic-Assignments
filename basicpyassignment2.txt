1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
A- there are only two Boolean values, True and False.


2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
A- Three different types of boolean operators are : AND, OR and NOT


3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
A-
X         Y    NOT(~X)   AND     OR
false	false	true	false	false
false	true	true	false	true
true	false	false	false	true
true	true	false	true	true



4. What are the values of the following expressions?
A-
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                                   False
not (5 > 4)                                            False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                                    True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))                              False
(True and True) and (True == False)                    False
(not False) or (not True)                              True


5. What are the six comparison operators?
A- 
Less than ( < )
Less than or equal to (<=)
Greater than (>)
Greater than or equal to (>=)
Equal to ( == )
Not equal to ( != )



6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
A-The ‘==’ operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If so, it returns true. Otherwise it returns false.
Whereas, assignment operators such as '=' and the like are used to assign a value to a variable.


7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
A-     block 1
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
	print('eggs')
	   block 2
if spam > 5:
	print('bacon')
else:
	print('ham')
        block 3	
print('spam')
print('spam')


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
A-
spam = input()

if spam == 1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings!')


9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?
A-If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, press Ctrl + C .


10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
A- When we use break, the program terminates at the condition set for breaking the loop.However in case of a continue program, the loop simply skips over the predefined condition.


11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
A-
range(10) is an example of range(stop), where the number 10 isn't included. 
range(0,10) is an example of range(start,stop) where 0 is where it starts and ends at 10 excluding 10.
range(0,10,1) is an example of range(start, stop, step) where 0 is where it starts and ends at 10 excluding 10 by taking 1 step between iterations


12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
A-   #for loop
     num = range(0,11)
	 for n in num:
		print(num)

	#While loop
	num = range(0,11)
	n = 1
	while n<=num:
		print(n)
		n = n + 1
	 
	 
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
A- This function can be called with spam.bacon().
