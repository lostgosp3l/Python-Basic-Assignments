1. What exactly is []?
[] is the syntactical notation for python lists.
 List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
spam[2] = 'hello'

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.
3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
'd'
4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
'd'
5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
'a' 'c'


Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
1
7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]
8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]  #It will remove one 'cat' per execution


9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
There are several ways to join, or concatenate, two or more lists in Python
1. '+' operator
2. Append()
list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

for x in list2:
  list1.append(x)

print(list1)

3.Extend()
list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)
You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because: list2 will only be a reference to list1, and changes made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.
There are ways to make a copy:
1. copy()
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
